## Design Notes
### Home Screen
The top image represents the home screen, this is what the application will revert to after a period of no activity or if the user returns back to the main screen. 

### Dashboard
The second image represents the dashboard view. This view will have quick versions of some of the applications on the device for example a quick view of the current sound levels and a quick view for adjusting the lights and turning them on and off.
