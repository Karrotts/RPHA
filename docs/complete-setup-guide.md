# RPHA Complete Setup Guide
The Raspberry Pi Home Assistant (RPHA) is true to its name, since it runs off a raspberry pi, so in order to do a complete setup for the application to work in the production environment there needs to be a bit of setup. This guide is intended to take you from all the different components to deploying the application onto your raspberry pi.
